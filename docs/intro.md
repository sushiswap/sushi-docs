# Introduction

## What Is Sushi?

Sushi is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem.” One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, Sushi’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, Sushi intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.

Thus far, the core products, which will be described in more detail here, include: a decentralized exchange, yield instruments, a cross-chain AMM, token streaming and vesting platform, an AMM framework and staking derivatives. Sushi’s products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to maintain decentralized governance of $SUSHI token holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations by design. Whereas major structural changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy and overall development is ultimately decided on by our core team.

The following documentation details the functional and technical aspects of the ecosystem products, as well as customized tutorials to walk you through all of Sushi's exciting features!
