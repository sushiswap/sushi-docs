### How do I submit my token and logo to be included on the exchange?

Anyone looking to get their token added to the SushiSwap exchange must first submit a request through our Partner Portal site; the URL for it can be found in our official links [here](/docs/Ecosystem/Official%20SushiSwap%20Links). After choosing the correct network and adding the token's address as well as its desired logo and background color, the team will review the submission and reach out with further instructions as soon as possible.

### What is impermanent loss (IL)?

CoinMarketCap defines impermanent loss as “the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair.” To put this into perspective, if you are holding an LP token, and one of the assets depreciates in value in the short term, but gradually returns to the original price, then you would have lost value "impermanently." Alternatively, if the same asset appreciated in value before reverting to the mean, you would have had "impermanent gains." These metrics can help liquidity providers balance their portfolios for optimal ratios. For instance, if you think a token will appreciate, and then revert to the mean, you might provide liquidity before it appreciates, just to accumulate the fees for that duration.

### My SLP's aren't showing up on the site or in my wallet?

If you have staked your Sushi Liquidity Provider (SLP) tokens in any of our farms, or on other platforms, the tokens are not in your wallet anymore and thus can't be tracked. If you wish to liquidate your position (exchange the SLP tokens back to the provided tokens), you must first unstake them from any farms. You can, however, check the value of your SLP tokens at [https://apy.vision/](https://apy.vision/).
