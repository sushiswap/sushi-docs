# Setting Up Your Wallet

When you go to sushi.com, enter the app and click "Connect Wallet," you will see a list of wallet options to choose from. For some beginners, this list can be daunting. To help out new users to our platform, we will show you how to set up a MetaMask wallet extension on your desktop.

### Setting up MetaMask 101

Step 1. Head over to [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io).

Step 2. Download and install the Metamask version compatible with your browser.

Step 3. After it's finished downloading, click "Get Started".

Step 5. Agree or disagree to information collection.

Step 6. Create your password (you won't need a username!).

Step 7. You will be given your backup phrase, also known as your "private key," which is made up of 12 words. It is good practice to write this down somewhere safe and never show or tell anyone these words. Anyone who has this phrase can access your assets and do as they please with them, so don't ever give it to anyone!

Step 8. Congratulations, your wallet has successfully been created! Your account number or wallet address will look something like this: 0x48F7D383399700ac1302aFF938cD46d138008676 or as seen in the photo below: 0x48F7...8676. If you click on this number (abbreviated below "Account 1"), your computer will automatically copy the address.

Step 9. If you already own cryptocurrencies you can add assets by copying your wallet address and sending the assets you own to that address.

Step 10. In order for your tokens to display in your wallet, you need to add the token first. Let's start by adding $SUSHI!

Step 11. To add the $SUSHI token to your wallet, start by heading to: [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)

Step 12. Search Sushi in the search bar and click the top result.

Step 13. Copy the contract address.

Step 14. Open MetaMask again. If you cannot find the extension, click the puzzle piece in the top right corner of your browser. You can pin MetaMask to your extensions for easier access as well.

Step 15. Click "Add Token"

Step 3. Select MetaMask then click "Connect" in the MetaMask pop-up.

Step 4. You will now see your wallet address in the top right corner.

You will need to approve Sushi's access for each individual token you use on the platform. For example, if you want to buy $SUSHI tokens with $USDC, you will need to approve Sushi's access to the USDC token by paying a small connection fee. As we mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, this fee, along with other fees on Ethereum, will need to be paid in Ether (ETH). So, in order to access the SushiSwap platform (or MISO, Kashi, etc.), you will need ETH in your wallet to pay the fees. If you do not have any Ether, you will need to purchase some from a centralized exchange which services your region.
