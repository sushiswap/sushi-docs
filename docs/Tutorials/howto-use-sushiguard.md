# Sushi Guard

> MEV, Front running, and arbitrage Protection for Sushi users

Sushi Guard protects you from ‘MEV’ - Maximal Extractable Value.

It is built using a service called OpenMEV from Manifold Finance.

MEV is the crypto-version of arbitrage trading / high-frequency trading that you typically see on Wall Street. Arbitrage bots are used to monitor the network, and when you submit a transaction, they will submit a transaction of their own and "bribe" the miner to place their transaction before yours and ten after your transaction. **This is called "Sandwiching"**. This has the effect of manipulating price and volume and is used to make a profit from your trades.

SushiGuard mitigates this type of malicious MEV by leveraging the power of Flashbots, Eden Network, and Manifold Finance's OpenMEV network.

> ✅ Sushi Guard protects traders from MEV: Maximal Extracted Value. MEV occurs when arbitrage bots see your transaction and use it to arbitrage against other users to _extract_ value from it.
